# STDISCM-Problem-Set-3
 This repository serves as the codebase for the solution to the third problem set for STDISCM (Term 3 A.Y. 2023-2024).

 To run the code, simply run the .jar files for server and client named ParticleClient.jar and ParticleServer.jar respectively.

 ### Prerequisites
 Before running the client, make sure that the `serverIP` and `serverPort` variables in ParticleClient's `connectToServer()` method **matches the IP address** that the ParticleServer is currently running on. If you're planning to run both the client and server on one machine, set the `serverIP` variable to **localhost**.

 For every change, don't forget to export the project as a .jar file.
